# Beautiful Destinations Website

This project showcases a collection of stunning images and biographies of three beautiful destinations: **Sunsets**, **Rwanda**, and **Mombasa**. Each section features 10 images from various sources, along with a 200-word biography that explains why the images were chosen. The website is designed to be visually appealing and provides an immersive experience for visitors.

## Project Overview

The website is divided into three main sections, each representing a different theme or destination:

1. **Sunsets**: A collection of breathtaking sunset images from around the world, showcasing the beauty of nature and how it transitions from day to night.
2. **Rwanda**: A celebration of the natural beauty and rich culture of Rwanda, including its wildlife, landscapes, and historical sites.
3. **Mombasa**: A visual tour of Mombasa, Kenya’s coastal city, with its beaches, cultural landmarks, and vibrant street life.

The site uses HTML, CSS, and images sourced from the internet to present an elegant and engaging visual experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The website uses CSS Grid to display images in a clean, evenly spaced grid format. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Images have a hover effect that subtly enlarges them when the user hovers over them, making the experience interactive.
- **Biography Sections**: Beneath each image grid, there is a biography explaining the significance of the images and why each destination was chosen. This provides context and enhances the educational aspect of the site.
- **Clean and Minimal Design**: The design focuses on the images, with a simple, modern layout that highlights the beauty of each destination.

## Files Included

1. `index.html` – The HTML file that structures the content of the website.
2. `styles.css` – The CSS file responsible for styling the page and making it visually appealing.
3. Image sources – Links to images sourced from publicly available websites.

## Installation

To get started, you can either view the website locally or host it on a server. Here are the steps for both options:

### Viewing Locally

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local computer.
2. Ensure that both the `index.html` and `styles.css` files are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

### Hosting on a Web Server

To host the website on a live server, you can use platforms like:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Upload both the `index.html` and `styles.css` files to your chosen platform, and follow the instructions to deploy the website.

## How the Website Works

1. **HTML Structure**:

   - The website is structured into three sections: Sunsets, Rwanda, and Mombasa. Each section contains an `h2` heading, a grid of 10 images, and a biography paragraph.
   - Each image has a `src` attribute pointing to an online image URL.
   - A footer provides copyright information.

2. **CSS Styling**:

   - The website uses Flexbox and Grid Layout to ensure that images are spaced evenly within each section.
   - The `.image-grid` class defines the grid for images, with `grid-template-columns` ensuring that the images are laid out in five equal columns.
   - A hover effect on images scales them slightly to provide interactivity.
   - The color scheme uses subtle tones to let the images stand out, with darker colors for headers and footers.

3. **Responsiveness**:
   - The layout is designed to be responsive. On smaller screens, such as mobile devices, the images will automatically stack vertically, ensuring that the content remains legible and accessible.

## Customization

You can customize this project to suit your needs. Here are a few ways you can make changes:

- **Change the images**: If you have specific images you'd like to display, simply replace the `src` attributes in the `img` tags with your new image URLs.
- **Modify the biography text**: Each section has a biography explaining why the images were chosen. Feel free to update these descriptions with your own text or add new sections.
- **Change the layout**: The CSS file is flexible. You can adjust the grid layout, colors, font styles, or spacing to better fit your desired aesthetic.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the website, including grid layouts, hover effects, and responsive design.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the website works well on devices of different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
